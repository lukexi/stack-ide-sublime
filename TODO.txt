[ ] Implement tooltips for type and doc information.
    See here for Sublime Text API:

    (maybe just use an "info" panel for this?)

    See here for ide-backend-client API:
    https://github.com/chrisdone/ide-backend-client/tree/master/ide-backend-client



[ ] Figure out autocompletion for qualified names, e.g. Map.insert
    It may be necessary to remove . from the "word_separators" sublime preference to get sublime to report the full name to the autocompletion plugin,
    i.e. change it to:
    "word_separators": "/\\()\"'-:,;<>~!@#$%^&*|+=[]{}`~?",
    (note that in the default there are two occurrences of . - be sure to remove them both)
    This wasn't quite enough, so test stack-ide/ide-backend to see if it handles qualified autocompletion correctly.



DONE:

[x] Completions are asynchronous, so we only see them if we type e.g. f<delete>f or on the second letter.
    See if we can re-trigger the completion list once the completions arrive.


[x] Implement getExpTypes to just follow the cursor around and place the type in the status bar?
    To complement the larger getSpanInfo above.
    Need to ensure it's persistent enough and maybe log it to a buffer too for copy-pasteability
    (Oh, we can probably use the status flag API for the persistence part)
